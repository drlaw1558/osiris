Intention is that the parameters in this file remain fixed in all routines.
If you want to change a value given in this file, you should have a good reason for it.
Not all values are independent, e.g. if you change AO transmission, AO emissivity must also be changed manually.
Parameters that can vary (e.g. redshift) must be determined when running program.
